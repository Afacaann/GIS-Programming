Agile :
In the Agile model, “fast failure” is a good thing. 
The approach produces ongoing release cycles, each featuring small, incremental changes from the previous release. 
At each iteration, the product is tested. The Agile model helps teams identify and address small issues on projects before they evolve into more significant problems 
and engage business stakeholders and get their feedback throughout the development process.

Waterfall :
Has only one rule ; finish one phase, then move on to the next. No going back. 
Each stage relies on information from the previous stage and has its own project plan. 
Sure, it’s easy to understand and simple to manage. But early delays can throw off the entire project timeline.

Iterative :
The Iterative model is repetition incarnate. 
Instead of starting with fully known requirements, project teams implement a set of software requirements, then test, evaluate and pinpoint further requirements.
A new version of the software is produced with each phase, or iteration. Rinse and repeat until the complete system is ready.

If you decided to use “the Waterfall model” , your plan has to be fully required for anything. 
Because of the “not turning back” thing you have to make things fully successful. But this is human kind, we make some mistakes everytime. 
So I think Waterfall model is not a best option for SDLC. 
In “Iterative Model” you always start to do something but it is not perfect. 
You always do the Projects half of it or you make things slice and slice and when you combined them they will not work. You do not know that but that is in the possibilty. 
I think “Agile Method” is the best of in this three models. We use cycles like Iterative again, we are especially looking forward to detect the mistakes unlike the Waterfall model. 
Always testing the software in every circle. If my future Works , I might use the Agile method in my projects.
